# World_Weather_Analysis

For this evaluation we are looking to answer the question "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" The obvious answer is that it gets hotter, but what information is there that actually proves that?

First, we took weather data supplied by the open weather map API (https://openweathermap.org/current), this provided the data for us to then search for and pull information based on specific parameters to evaluate. Once the list of cities is determined, we are then able to evaluate the data and compare northern vs. southern hemispheres and see that in fact the weather does get warmer as one approaches the equator. Please note that the temperatures are listed in Kelvin, I was not able to correct for this, every attempt I made would break the code and would result in an empty cities.csv file.

Second, we took a look at the weather, and made a determination on what would be ideal for the location of a vacation trip. Using thos parameters we were able to determine a list of cities that would appear to be ideal from a weather prespective for a vacation.

For this code I used examples from class, as well as resources in the form of my copy of Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter 3rd Editiion by Wes McKinney (https://wesmckinney.com/book/), and exmaples from previous assignments.
